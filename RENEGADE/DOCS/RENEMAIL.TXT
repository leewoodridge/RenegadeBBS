                                 INTRODUCTION
         _________________________________________________________________

             This documentation assumes that you have a working knowledge of
        Fidonet  echomail  processing.  It  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this
        documentation  to  explain  the  concepts  of  networking  and  mail
        processing.  You should  refer to  your echomail processing system's
        documentation for more information.

             Renemail  is  an  interface  program  that allows  Renegade  to
        support  Echomail  from  any  network  supporting Fidonet standards.
        Renemail  is  a  very  simplistic  program  at  this  point  in  its
        development.  It has only three major functions:


          o    Scanning - Renemail will  scan  Renegade's  Echomail  message
               bases  and process outbound messages, translating  them  into
               Fidonet compatible *.MSG  files for  further processing by an
               echomail processing system and your front-end mailer.

          o    Tossing  - Renemail   will   import  *.MSG   format  messages
               prepared  by  your  front-end  mailer and echomail processing
               system into the appropriate Renegade message bases.

          o    Purging  - Renemail will optionally purge  imported or tossed
               messages from your echomail directories.


          o    Netmail  - Renemail will import and export netmail to and
               from your Email system.


             Renemail does  not have its own configuration.  Renemail relies
        completely  on your  Renegade Bulletin  Board System's configuration
        for all necessary information.


                                    REQUIREMENTS
         _________________________________________________________________


             Renemail is  not a  stand-alone  package.  You  will  need  the
        following additional programs:

          o    The Renegade Bulletin Board System version v1.25/DOS

          o    A front-end mailer.  Front end  mailers  are  responsible for
               answering incoming calls, and the  transmission and reception
               of outbound and inbound mail and files. Some available front-
               end mailers are:

                 o FrontDoor    o BinkleyTerm   o SeaDog   o D'Bridge

          o    An echomail processing system. The echomail processing system
               is responsible for processing  inbound and  outbound mail for
               Renemail  and  the front-end  mailer to work  together.  Some
               commonly used echomail processing systems are:

                 o GEcho  o Vpurge  o Qmail  o SquishMail  o TosScan


                                  INSTALLATION
         _________________________________________________________________


             If you have not already, decompress the  Renemail  distribution
        archive onto your  hard drive.  RENEMAIL.EXE  is the  only  required
        program in the archive.It can be placed anywhere on your hard drive,
        and run from anywhere  on your system.  It  is, however, recommended
        that you place it in your main Renegade directory.

             When Renemail runs, it needs to be able to locate your system's
        RENEGADE.DAT file. Renemail will first search the current directory,
        then it will search your path.   If  you are  not  running  Renemail
        from your main Renegade directory, then make sure your main Renegade
        directory is part of your path.  It is strongly recommended that you
        run Renemail from your  main directory  and that you  NOT  have your
        Renegade main directory in your path statement for security reasons.


                                   OPERATION
         _________________________________________________________________

            Renemail has  only three  major  command  line options. They are
        mutually exclusive.  Renemail will  only perform the  first function
        specified on the command line, regardless of what it is  or how many
        other functions are specified.

              Syntax:

                         RENEMAIL [FUNCTION]

          Where [FUNCTION] is one of the following:

             -S   -  Scan messages.  As explained previously, this scans new
                     messages in Renegade echomail  bases and  prepares them
                     for outbound  processing  by  your  echo  processor. Do
                     this before  any outbound echo processing.

             -T   -  Toss  messages.  Also  as  previously  explained,  this
                     tosses  inbound  echo  messages  into  the  appropriate
                     Renegade message bases.  Do this after any inbound echo
                     processing.

             -P   -  Purge messages.  This  function  deletes all  the *.MSG
                     files in all of your echomail directories.  This should
                     be used  with care as  not to delete  outbound messages
                     that  have  not  yet  been processed  by your  echomail
                     processor, or  inbound messages  that have not yet been
                     tossed by Renemail into Renegade message bases.  If you
                     are having problems with Renemail  NOT deleting all  of
                     the *.MSG  files, use  -P -F  which  specifies Renemail
                     should NOT use the fast method of purging.


             Renemail has four  additional command line options which are
         not mutually exclusive:

             -A   -  Absolute scan.  Normally, Renemail  scans  only message
                     bases with new outbound messages.  This  flag indicates
                     that Renemail should scan all echomail bases.

             -D   -  Do not delete netmail. This is used in conjunction with
                     the -T (Toss) command, and forces  Renemail  to  update
                     the  status bits  of imported  netmail messages  rather
                     than deleting them after being tossed.

             -F   -  Do not use the fast purge option.  On some systems, the
                     normal fast purge does not work corectly.  If the purge
                     option does  not appear  to be deleting the *.MSG files
                     in your echomail directories, use this option.

             -I   -  Do NOT ignore 1.MSG.  Most mail processors use 1.MSG to
                     store data  for  mail processing. Some don't. If  yours
                     does NOT, and you want  to import 1.MSG, then  use this
                     option.

             -L   -  Log all activity from Renemail.  This stores a log file
                     in your \RENEGADE\LOGS directory called RENEMAIL.LOG.

             -N   -  No netmail.  This  indicates to  Renemail that  netmail
                     should  not  be  scanned, tossed, or  purged during the
                     current mail processing session.

             -O   -  Only scan/toss the Netmail base




                                 USING THE SYSTEM
         _________________________________________________________________


             As stated before, Renemail has been created to  work with other
        programs to operate correctly.   Renemail  only  translates  between
        Renegade and the echo mail processor of your choice.Because of this,
        you   are   responsible  for  executing  the  previously   mentioned
        processing system(s) in relation to Renemail.

             About the only  efficient way to perform these  tasks is to use
        batch files. It is recommended that you use one batch file that runs
        your front-end mailer, Renegade, Renemail, and anything else used in
        your BBS's daily routine.  This batch file should be written in such
        a way  that whenever  inbound mail is received, the front-end mailer
        exits and the  echomail processor and Renemail are both executed, in
        that order.  When Renegade  signals via  ERRORLEVEL  that  new  echo
        mail has  been  entered  in  the  message  bases, Renemail  and  the
        echomail processor should again be run, in that order.

             Here is an example of what  should take  place when an incoming
        echomail packet is received.  This  example uses Confmail because it
        is the simplest echomail processor available.   The example  assumes
        your main Renegade directory is D:\RENEGADE,and that you are running
        both programs from there. It also assumes you will be using PKWare's
        PKUNPAK to unarc incoming Arcmail packets.


             CD C:\RENEGADE                   {Change to the main directory   }
             GECHO TOSS PACK                  {Execute echomail processor     }
             RENEMAIL -T                      {Invoke Renemail's TOSS function}
             RENEMAIL -P                      {Optionally PURGE echomail dirs }


             Equally simplistic is the following example of  what your batch
        file  should   do  when  it is  detected  that new echomail has been
        entered  in  Renegade, or whenever  you want to process new outbound
        mail.  Please note that  the order in which these two programs   are
        executed is crucial to correct operation.


             CD C:\RENEGADE                   {Change to the main directory   }
             RENEMAIL -S                      {Invoke Renemail's SCAN function}
             GECHO SCAN PACK                  {Execute echomail processor     }
             RENEMAIL -P                      {Optionally PURGE echomail dirs }


             The RENEMAIL -P (or PURGE) function is optional,but recommended
        mainly to save disk space.  It will not  affect mail  processing, as
        Renemail  and  your  echomail processing system will not process the
        messages twice.  The above  example for exporting mail does not have
        Confmail arcing outgoing packets.  This  can  be added  easily using
        Confmail's  -A and -D  commands.  Using  Arcmail  is recommended for
        shorter  mail  transmission times.  If  you  have  trouble  with the
        purging function, try:

              RENEMAIL -P -F

             We recommend that the first echo you  attempt to pick up is the
        National Renegade Echo.  The author  of this  program is in there to
