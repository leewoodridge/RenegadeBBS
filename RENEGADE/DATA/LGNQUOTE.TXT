If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp,

If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to
tell him is "God is crying."  And if he asks why God is
crying, another cute thing to tell him is "Probably because
of something you did."

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no

If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting

Better not take a dog on the Space Shuttle, because if he

To me, clowns aren't funny.  In fact, they're kinda scary.
I've wondered where this started, and I think it goes back
to the time I went to the circus and a clown killed my dad.

I'd like to see a nude opera, because when they hit those

Contrary to popular belief, the most dangerous animal is not
the lion or tiger or even the elephant.  The most dangerous
animal is a shark riding on an elephant, just trampling and
eating everything they see.

As we were driving we saw a sign that said "Watch For
Rocks." Marta said it should read "Watch For Pretty Rocks." 
I told her she should write in her suggestion to the highway
department, but she started saying it was a joke--just to
get out of writing a simple letter  And I thought I was lazy

As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about
it that was very pleasurable--until I realized it wasn't a

Once, when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a
mysterious old stranger.  He said he was about to die and
wanted to tell someone about the treasure. I said, "Okay, as
long as it's not a long story. Some of us have a plane to
catch, you know." He started telling his story, about the
treasure and his life and all, and I thought: "This story
isn't too long."  But then, he kept going, and I started
thinking, "Uh-oh, this story is getting long."  But then,
the story was over, and I said to myself: "You know, that
story wasn't too long after all." I forget what the story
was about, but there was a good movie on the plane.  It was
a little long, though.

Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful

he's carrying a beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's

you're drunk.

I guess of all my uncles, I liked Uncle Cave Man the best. 
We called him Uncle Cave Man because he lived in a cave and
because sometimes he'd eat one of us.  Later on we found out
he was a bear.

Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto

In weightlifting, I don't think sudden, uncontrolled

If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off,

The memories of my family outings are still a source of
strength to me. I remember we'd all pile into the car--I
forget what kind it was--and drive and drive.  I'm not sure
where we'd go, but I think there were some trees there.  The
smell of something was strong in the air as we played
whatever sport we played.  I remember a bigger, older guy we
called "Dad." We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think
we went home. I guess some things never leave you.

He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land.  He loved it
so much he made a woman out of dirt and married her.  But
when he kissed her, she disintegrated.  Later, at the
funeral, when the preacher said "Dust to dust," some people
laughed, and the cowboy shot them.  At his hanging, he told
the others, "I'll be waiting for you in heaven--with a gun."

Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little
trick to calm myself down.  I'll go over to the person's
house and ring the doorbell. When the person comes to the
door, I'm gone, but you know what I've left on the porch?  A
jack-o'-lantern with a knife in the side of its head with a
note that says "You." After that, I usually feel a lot
better, and no harm done.

I can still recall old Mister Barnslow getting out every
morning and nailing a fresh load of tadpoles to that old
board of his.  The he'd spin it round and round, like a
wheel of fortune, and no matter where it stopped he'd yell
out, "Tadpoles   Tadpoles is a winner " We all thought he
was crazy.  But then, we had some growing up to do.

If I ever opened a trampoline store, I don't think I'd call
it Trampo-Land, because you might think it was a store for
tramps, which is not the impression we are trying to convey
with our store.  On the other hand, we would not prohibit
tramps from browsing, or testing the trampolines, unless a
tramp's gyrations seemed to be getting out of control.

I remember that fateful day when Coach took me aside.  I
knew what was coming.  "You don't have to tell me," I said. 
"I'm off the team, aren't I?" "Well," said the Coach, "you
never were really _on_ the team.  You made that uniform
you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a
toy space helmet.  You show up at practice and then either
steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you
try to tackle people at inappropriate times." It was all
true what he was saying.  And yes, I thought, something is
brewing inside the head of this Coach.  He sees something in
me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold.  But that's
when I felt the handcuffs go on.

When I heard that trees grow a new "ring" for each year they

If you're at a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the

pretend like you're eating it, but instead, put it all in

when you're out back having cigars with the boys, let out a
big, fake cough and throw the ball to the ground.  Then say,
"Boy, these are good cigars "

I scrambled to the top of the precipice where Nick was

Nick.  "Let's climb higher." "No," I said.  "I think we

I said we didn't, and Nick said we did.  We argued back and
forth like that for about 20 minutes, then finally decided
to head back. I didn't say it was an interesting story.

To me, truth is not some vague, foggy notion.  Truth is real.

Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk,

You know what would make a good story?  Something about a

I bet a fun thing would be to go back in time to where there
was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have
come to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the
sky."  Just then the eclipse would start, and they'd
probably try to kill you or something, but then you could
explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone
would have a good laugh.

Today I accidentally stepped on a snail on the sidewalk in

I build a defensive wall around myself, a "shell" if you

One thing kids like is to be tricked.  For instance, I was
going to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead
drove him to an old, burned-out warehouse.  "Oh no," I said,
"Disneyland burned down." He cried and cried, but I think
that deep down, he thought it was a pretty good joke. I
started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was
getting pretty late.

Sometimes the beauty of the world is so overwhelming, I just

Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's
say you're an astronaut on the moon and you fear that your
partner has been turned into Dracula.  The next time he goes
out for the moon pieces, wham , you just slam the door
behind him and blast off.  He might call you on the radio
and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, "Think again,
bat man."

I wish scientists would come up with a way to make dogs a

I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fishermen caught a
big shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole
person.  Then they cut the person open, and in him is a
little baby shark.  And in the baby shark there isn't a
person, because it would be too small.  But there's a little
doll or something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy--
something like that.

It makes me mad when I go to all the trouble of having Marta

They eat fish." Sure they eat fish, if that's all you give
them.  Man, wise up.

If the Vikings were around today, they would probably be

We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients.  But we

It's not good to let any kid near a container that has a

If you had a school for professional fireworks people, I

If I lived back in the Wild West days, instead of carrying a
six-gun in my holster, I'd carry a soldering iron.  That way,
if some smart-aleck cowboy said something like "Hey, look. 
He's carrying a soldering iron " and started laughing, I
could just say, "That's right, it's a soldering iron.  The
soldering iron of justice." Then everybody would get real
quiet and ashamed, because they made fun of the soldering
iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free
drink.

$
If you're a circus clown, and you have a dog that you use in
your act, I don't think it's a good idea to also dress the

Here's a good joke to do during an earthquake: straddle a

If you ever go temporarily insane, don't shoot somebody,

I think a good idea to get into a movie is to show up where
they're making the movie, then stick a big cactus plant onto

Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the

separate words--"mank" and "ind." What do these words mean? 
It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.

Children need encouragement.  So if a kid gets an answer

I think a good novel would be where a bunch of men on a ship
are looking for a whale.  They look and look, but you know
what?  They never find him. And you know why they never find
him?  It doesn't say.  The book leaves it up to you, the
reader, to decide. Then, at the very end, there's a page you
can lick and it tastes like Kool-Aid.

I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate

Probably the earliest fly swatters were nothing more than

To me, it's always a good idea to always carry two sacks of

I remember we were all horrified to see Grandpa up on the

arms, like he was going to fly.  I forget what happened
after that.

If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in

Just because swans mate for life, I don't think it's that
big of a deal. First of all, if you're a swan, you're
probably not going to find a swan that looks that much
better than the one you've got, so why not mate for life.

If you're robbing a bank, and your pants suddenly fall down,

You can't tell me that cowboys, when they're branding cattle,

One day one of my little nephews came up to me and asked me

he would forget what he asked me.

When you first start wearing a turban, probably the most
common mistake is wrapping it too tight.  You have to allow
the head to breathe.

If you go through a lot of hammers each month, I don't think
it necessarily means you're a hard worker.  It may just mean
that you have a lot to learn about proper hammer maintenance.

When people say that the desert is lifeless, it just makes
me want to grab them by the collar and yell, "Why you stupid,
stupid bastard "  Then I drive them out into the desert to
where the circus is, and point out the many forms of zebra
and clown life.

If there was a big gardening convention, and you got up and
gave a speech in favor of fast-motion gardening, I bet you
would get booed off the stage. They're just not ready.

We like to praise birds for flying.  But how much of it is
actually flying, and how much of it is just sort of coasting
from the previous flap?

Instead of raising your hand to ask a question in class, how
about individual push buttons on each desk?  That way, when
you want to ask a question, you just push the button and it
lights up a corresponding number on a tote board at the
front of the class.  Then all the professor has to do is
check the lighted number against a master sheet of names and
numbers to see who is asking the question.

If you're a boxing referee, it's probably illegal to wear a
bow tie that spins or changes colors.

You know something that would really make me applaud?  A guy
gets stuck in quicksand, then sinks, then suddenly comes
shooting out, riding on water skis   How do they do that?

Whether they live in an igloo or a grass shack or a mud hut,
people around the world all want the same thing: a better

When you're going up the stairs and you take a step, kick
the other leg up high behind you to keep people from

When Rick told me he was having trouble with his wife, I had
to laugh.  Not because of what he said, but because of a
joke I thought of.  I told him the joke, but he didn't
laugh very much.  Some friend HE is.

If you ever reach total enlightenment while you're drinking

Love is not something that you can put chains on and throw
into a lake. That's called Houdini.  Love is liking someone
a lot.

If I was being executed by lethal injection, I'd clean up my
cell real neat.  Then, when they came to get me, I'd say,
"Injection?  I thought you said 'inspection.'"  They'd
probably feel real bad, and maybe I could get out of it.

I'm not afraid of insects taking over the world, and you
know why?  It would take about a billion ants just to aim a
gun at me, let alone fire it.  And you know what I'm doing
while they're aiming it at me?  I just sort of slip off to
the side, and then suddenly run up and kick the gun out of
their hands.

I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not
our children's children, because I don't think children
should be having sex.

If you're a blacksmith, probably the proudest day of your
life is when you get your first anvil.  How innocent you are,
little blacksmith.

What am I afraid of?  I'll tell you: a feather.  That's
right, a feather. How could anyone be afraid of a feather,
you say.  That's an honest question, and I'll try to give an
honest answer.  First of all, did I say it was a poison
feather?

When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular
heaven and pie heaven, choose pie heaven.  It might be a

Of all the warning sounds that animals make, I think the one

I bet a funny thing about driving a car off a cliff is,
while you're in midair, you still hit those brakes   Hey,

I wish there was a disease where you're afraid of clouds,
because I think I could cure it.  First, you sit the patient
down and have a long, personal talk.  After that, I'm not
sure, but maybe you could throw water in his face or
something.

As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to
red again, I sat there thinking about life.  Was it nothing
more than a bunch of honking and yelling?  Sometimes it
seemed that way.

How come the dove gets to be the peace symbol?  How about
the pillow?  It has more feathers than the dove, and it
doesn't have that dangerous beak.

Even though I was their captive, the Indians allowed me
quite a bit of freedom.  I could walk about freely, make my
own meals, and even hurl large rocks at their heads.  It was
only later that I discovered they were not Indians after all,
but dirty clothes hampers.

If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the

I wish outer-space guys would conquer Earth and make people

I think Superman and Santa Claus are actually the same guy,

Frank knew that no man had ever crossed the desert on foot

It's true that every time you hear a bell, an angel gets his
wings.  But what they don't tell you is, every time you hear
a mousetrap snap, an angel gets set on fire.

If I was a father in a waiting room, and the nurse came out
and said, "Congratulations, it's a girl," I think a good gag
would be to get real mad and yell, "A girl ?  You must have
me mixed up with THAT dork " and point to another father.

I bet what happened was, they discovered fire and invented

The wise man can pick up a grain of sand and envision a
whole universe. But the stupid man will just lay down on
some seaweed and roll around until he's completely draped in
it.  Then he'll stand up and go, "Hey, I'm Vine Man."

I remember how, in college, I got that part-time job as a
circus clown, and how the children would laugh and laugh at
me.  I vowed, then and there, that I would get revenge.

If I could be a bird, I think I'd be a penguin, because then
I could walk around on two feet with a lot of other guys

The big, huge meteor headed toward the Earth.  Could nothing
stop it? Maybe Bob could.  He was suddenly on top of the
meteor--through some kind of space warp or something.  "Go,
Bob, go " yelled one of the generals. "Give me that " said
the big-guy general as he took the microphone away. "Listen,
Bob," he said.  "You've got to steer that meteor away from
Earth." "Yes, but how?" thought Bob.  Then he got an idea. 
Right next to him there was a steering wheel sticking out of
the meteor.

If I could come back as a horsefly, I think my favorite

I think a new, different kind of bowling should be "carpet
bowling."  It's just like regular bowling, only the lanes
are carpet instead of wood.  I don't know why we should do
this, but my God, we've got to try something

Isn't it funny how whenever we go to a county fair or a

People laugh when I say that I think a jellyfish is one of
the most beautiful things in the world.  What they don't

If you want to be the popular one at a party, here's a good
thing to do: Go up to some people who are talking and
laughing and say, "Well, technically that's illegal."  It
might just fit in with what somebody just said.  And even if
it doesn't, so what, I hate this stupid party.

To us, it might look like just a rag.  But to the brave,
embattled men of the fort, it was more than that.  It was a
flag of surrender.  And after that, it was torn up and used
for shoe-shine rags, so the men would look nice for the
surrender.

I think one way police departments could make some money
would be to hold a yard sale of murder weapons.  Many people,
for example, could probably use a cheap ice pick.

There are many stages to a man's life.  In the first stage,
he is young and eager, like a beaver.  In the second stage,
he wants to build things, like dams, and maybe chew down
some trees.  In the third stage, he feels trapped, and then
"skinned."  I'm not sure what the fourth stage is.

I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so
bummed out that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a
few years, because I was thinking about doing that anyway.

If aliens from outer space ever come and we show them our
civilization and they make fun of it, we should say we were
just kidding, that this isn't our real civilization, but a
gag we hoped they would like.  Then we tell them to come
back in twenty years to see our real civilization.  After
that, we start a crash program of coming up with a new
civilization.  Either that, or just shoot down the aliens as
they're waving good-bye.

I wish I could shrink down to the size of an ant.  And maybe
there would be thousands of other people shrunken down to
ant-size, and we would get together and dig tunnels down
into the ground, and live there.  But don't ever call us
"ants," because we hate that.

If you're travelling in a time machine, and you're eating
corn on the cob, I don't think it's going to affect things
one way or the other.  But here's the point I'm trying to
make: Corn on the cob is good, isn't it.

I bet if you were a mummy wrapper in ancient Egypt, one
thing you would constantly find yourself telling people
would be, "Be sure, before I start, you have all the jewelry
and so forth on the body, because I am NOT unwrapping him
later."

If you're ever selling your house, and some people come by,
and a big rat comes out and he's dragging the rattrap
because it didn't quite kill him, just tell the people he's
your pet and that's a trick you taught him.

You know one thing that will make a woman mad?  Just run up

It seemed to me that, somehow, the blue jay was trying to
communicate with me.  I would see him fly into the house
across the way, pick up the telephone, and dial.  My phone
would ring, and it would be him, but it was just this
squawking and cheeping.  "What?   What? " I would yell back,
but he never did speak English.

If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at
some guys, throw one of those little baby-type pumpkins. 
Maybe it'll make everyone think of how crazy war is, and
while they're thinking, you can throw a real grenade.
