My coding partner Lee Woodridge has not been heard from in over a year. When we set this up on GitHub we used his account, as he liked this better than just swapping code back and forth. Over time I came to appreciate it as well. I fear he may remove his account and the storage for the code will be lost. So, in that sense, I am moving it back to my account "just in case".  http://github.com/Renegade-Exodus/Renegade

PLEASE DO NOT UPDATE THIS LOCATION and visit http://github.com/Renegade-Exodus/Renegade for the current codebase.

Last release I made was in Sept. 2024, and I made a few minor changes since I released that version, but nothing worth a "full" release. I will slowly update this as I feel to make any changes.
